tests:
- basic parse test one:
    parser: parse_string
    input: asdf
    expected: asdf
    # print: True

- basic range test one:
    parser: parse_int_range
    input: 8-9
    expected: [8,9]
    # print: True

- testing out error:
    parser: parse_int_range
    input: Good luck parsing this!
    expected error: Invalid int range
    # print: True

- relative date parse with plus:
    parser: parse_date
    input: a+day+ago
    expected error: "Invalid date: a+day+ago"

##   can't really test this, because I end up using the same parser for input *and* output,
##   so nothing is really being tested here? Can't verify its sanity, but verifies it doesn't crash...
# - relative date parse with spaces:
#     parser: parse_date
#     input: a day ago
#     expected: a day ago
