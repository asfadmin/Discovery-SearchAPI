# Notes on Cloudformation

TODO:

- Are there other keys besides 'AllowOrigins' I need for CORS for the API?
- Cloudfront cache disabled on old distro. Is that what we want?
- Add DENY for tag/untag resources outside of SearchAPI? https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/access-control-overview.html
